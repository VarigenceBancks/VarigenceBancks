Hello, 

I'm Bancks, Varigence's Senior Technical Support Engineer. 

I'd love to hear bug reports or feature requests that you find with any of our products such as BimlFlex or BimlStudio. I also keep track of BimlExpress and website bugs, but can't make promises on resolutions or timelines for those. I'll do my best to keep up with anything that comes in here, but official support requests should go through the online portal or support mailbox.

Happy BIML-ing!
